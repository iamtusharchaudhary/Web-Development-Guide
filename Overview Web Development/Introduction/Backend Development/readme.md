# Back-End Development
Backend development is the creation and maintenance of the server side of a web application. It involves managing the server, databases, and application logic to ensure smooth functionality. <br/>
#### Backend developers work with languages are:-
<ul>
  <li>JavScript</li>
  <li>Node.js</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>Php</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Backend Developer handling tasks such as server management, database interactions, and security measures. They enable communication between the front-end and back-end, ensuring the overall performance and functionality of the web application. A Back-End developer handles servers, databases, and APIs. In short, one who stores and organizes data communicates with the UI (Front-End) and performs server-side management. 

# Server , APIs , and Middleware
> Server Management : Knowledge of how to configure, manage, and deploy servers is crucial. This includes understanding web servers like Apache, Nginx, and cloud-based solutions.

> RESTful APIs and GraphQL : Creating and consuming APIs is a significant part of backend development. REST and GraphQL are popular methodologies for designing web APIs for applications to communicate with the server.

> Middleware : Middleware functions to handle requests and responses within your applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. Understanding middleware is key for tasks like authentication, data processing, and routing.
